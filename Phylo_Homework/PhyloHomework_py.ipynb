    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you will practice your newly acquired skills in phylogenetic inference and \"tree thinking\", by analyzing the evolutionary history of a gene family. Please note that unlike the tutorial, this exercise should be completed _on your own_. If you have questions, please reach out to me via e-mail (virag.varga@chalmers.se) or message me on Canvas. The assignment should be uploaded to Canvas as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file) by **23.59 on Friday, February 23, 2023**, along with the requested supplementary files. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not already have this Jupyter Notebook downloaded (i.e., if you haven't cloned the GitHub repo, [here](https://github.com/V-Varga/BBT045-Phylo-2024/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)), you can use `wget` to download the Jupyter Notebook version of this file from [here](PhyloHomework_py.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise you are going to follow the phylogenetic analysis workflow discussed during the lecture and tutorial, starting with collecting the data necessary for running the analysis (in the form of homologous protein sequences from different species), through the interpretation of the results (i.e., comparing species trees and gene trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will be working with species within a phylum of protists (single-celled eukaryotes) known as the Apicomplexans. Apicomplexans are mostly obligate parasites, meaning that they rely entirely on their host organism to survive. There is debate over the possibility of some species from this phylum being host-associated but non-parasitic, and some recently-discovered Apicomplexans are thought to be free-living, though they are not well-studied (del Campo et al. 2019). \n",

    "A Newick tree for the clades of interest is provided below (as well as in the Apicomplexa_clades.nwk file): \n",

    "> (Gregarinasia,(Cryptosporidia,((Piroplasmida,Haemosporidia),Coccidia)));\n",

    "When visualized as a cladogram, the tree looks like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "![Phylogenetic tree of key clades in Apicomplexa](figs/Apicomplexa_clades.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are listed the species you will be working with: \n",
    " - _Porospora gigantea_ \n",
    " - _Plasmodium falciparum_\n",
    " - _Babesia microti_\n",
    " - _Toxoplasma gondii_\n",
    " - _Cryptospodidium parvum_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Which clade of Apicomplexa do each of the above species belong to? List them below. \n",
    "\n",
    "> - _Porospora gigantea_ : Gregarinasia\n",
    "> - _Plasmodium falciparum_ : Haemosporidia\n",
    "> - _Babesia microti_ : Piroplasmida\n",
    "> - _Toxoplasma gondii_ : Coccidia\n",
    "> - _Cryptospodidium parvum_ : Cryptosporidia\n",
    "\n",
    "You might recognize some of these names! Phylum Apicomplexa contains a number of medically important parasites: \n",
    " - _Cryptosporidium_ species cause Cryptosporidiosis, a water-borne diarrheal disease that often affects immunocompromised people. \n",
    " - _Babesia_ species cause Babesiosis, a tick-borne illness that causes flu-like symptoms. Since the parasite infects and destroys red blood cells, it can also cause anemia. \n",
    " - _Toxoplasma gondii_ causes the disease Toxoplasmosis, which humans contract from food and/or being around pets that are infected. Most infections are asymptomatic, though it can cause flu-like symptoms and serious complications for the fetus if contracted during pregnancy, up to stillbirth or miscarriage. \n",
    " - _Plasmodium falciparum_ is a causative agent of Malaria, a disease which still kills more than half a million people each year. Among the _Plasmodium_ species, _P. falciparum_ causes the most deadly strain of the disease. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Gregarines are comparatively mild parasites - they infect invertebrates, and are rarely fatal to the organisms they infect. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Why might it be important to study organisms like the Gregarines? (Hint: Take another look at the phylogenetic tree of Apicomplexa.)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Since the Gregarines are related to the others but are not as fatal, helps us find WHAT makes them more fatal. #todo \n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving on to the actual phylogenetic workflow, you should also decide what the outgroup will be. This won't actually come into play until the visualization stage, but it's always good practice to be thinking ahead when following a research pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Which group of organisms should be the outgroup? _Why?_\n",
    "\n",
    "> A member of the Gregarines, for example _Porospora gigantea_, since they are closely related to the others but are not pathogenic. #todo too close to the others? \"_What is an outgroup? A species that is related to all organisms in the analysis. But not so closely that it would confuse the phylogenetic signal_\"\n",
    "\n",
    "You may be wondering, \"Why not select an outgroup from elsewhere in Alveolata (the superphylum that Apicompla belongs to)?\" After all, the Gregarines are considered part of Apicomplexa - aren't they too closely related to the rest to be useful in a study like this? \n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases, you might be right! A group of organisms like those in Chromerida, which are also in Alveolata but not considered Apicomplexans, might be a better choice! \n",
    "\n",
    "> (Chromerida,(Gregarinasia,(Cryptosporidia,((Piroplasmida,Haemosporidia),Coccidia))));\n",
    "\n",
    "![Phylogeny of Alveolata, showing Chromerida and Apicomplexa](figs/Apicomplexa_clades_outgroup.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we'll be using the Gregarines because of the gene families presented to you as options - all of these gene families are involved in the \"glideosome,\" which is a key component of Apicomplexan pathogenicity. The glidesome is involved in parasite attachment to, movement along and invasion of host cells. More distantly related species within Alveolata may not have copies of these genes. For example, _C. velia_ doesn't have a copy of the ROM4 gene (Boisard et al. 2022)."

    "## Obtaining & Exploring Data\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, you will be obtaining your own data from the NCBI database. \n",
    "\n",
    "You will start by selecting a gene family to study. Below I've listed a few options: \n",
    " - ROM4\n",
    " - AKMT\n",
    " - MyosinA\n",
    " - DGK1\n",
    "\n",
    "Since _Plasmodium falciparum_ and _Toxoplasma gondii_ have really well-annoted genomes, search for the gene sequence of your choice on the NCBI with, for example: \"Plasmodium falciparum[orgn] ROM4\". Save the header and amino acid sequence to a FASTA file on your local machine. I've provided _recommended_ search combinations below to make things go a bit more smoothly; the members of these protein families do not all include these gene family names in the actual names of the individual genes themselves on the NCBI. If there are multiple results, just go with the first gene hit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Search _recommendations_: \n",
    " - ROM4: _P. falciparum_ ROM4\n",
    " - MyosinA: _P. falciparum_ Myosin-A\n",
    " - AKMT: _T. gondii_ apical complex lysine methyltransferase\n",
    " - DGK1: _T. gondii_  diacylglycerol kinase accessory domain\n",
    "\n",
    "Save the FASTA sequence of your selected reference protein representative of your chosen protein family to a file on your local computer. **This file should be included in your assignment submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you'll need to obtain homologous gene sequences from the NCBI database. BLAST your protein sequence on the web to accomplish this, and choose the \"FASTA (complete sequence)\" download option. **This file should be included in your assignment submission.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can select specific organisms to BLAST against on the NCBI - this significantly reduces the amount of time a search takes, and in our case, makes sure you get only the information you're looking for. There are of course many members of the Apicomplexa that we will not be working with here - no need to sift through all of the gene sequences from those organisms. Include only our 5 species of interest; note that you'll need to select both the A and B versions of _P. gigantea_ individually.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Open your multiple sequence FASTA and describe some of its characteristics. How many sequences are in the file? How many representatives of each species are there (count the two _P. gigantea_ species as only one)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> There are 75 sequences in the file:\n",
    "> - 31 from Plasmodium falciparum\n",
    "> - 28 from Toxoplasma gondii\n",
    "> - 2 from Babesia microti\n",
    "> - 10 from Porospora gigantea (both)\n",
    "> - 4 from Cryptosporidium parvum\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Describe the following examples with all words that apply from among: homologous, orthologous, paralogous\n",
    "\n",
    " a. Two copies of MyosinA in _B. microti_\n",
    "\n",
    " > Homologous, paralogous #todo Klart?\n",
    "\n",
    " b. Copies of AKMT in _P. falcigarum_ and _T. gondii_\n",
    "\n",
    " > Homologous, ortologous #todo Klart?\n",
    "\n",
    "Before proceeding on to the construction of the MSA, clean your sequences. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Do you notice any differences in the files? What does this tell you? \n",
    "\n",
    "> The names/headers are standardized with underscores between words instead of spaces or brackets.\n",
    "> The 94 byte count difference comes from that the clean_MSA_seqs has removed 75 closing brackets, 6 commas and 13 colons, which sum to 94. It has therefore not removed any non-standard characters in the sequences. #todo"
